    <h1>Ahaan Kirloskar Saini</h1>
    <p>Hi. I'm a final year MSci Mathematics student at University College London. I intend to maintain this website to host some of my work, and share some ideas.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>UCL Final Year Project</strong>
            <p>I'll update this as the project comes along.</p>
            <p><strong>Materials</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="cosavgs.pdf" target="_blank">A text</a> about some cosine averages and their convergence to zero.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><i>This was part of a group project. We decided to collect only the results necessary to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. By recording a few more results, the treatment may be offered in the more general context of ordered fields inside which every positive element has a square root, and every odd-degree polynomial has a zero. This could lead to a study of the "algebraic closure" of a field.</i></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Galois' Theory and the algebraic closedness of \(\mathbf{C}\)</strong>
            <p>A proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra is presented, using ideas from Galois' Theory.</p>
            <p><strong>Materials</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="Galois.pdf" target="_blank">Slides</a> presented to professors, and classmates of the Galois' Theory class at UCL in December 2024</li>
            </ul>

            <strong>UCL Year 2 Research Project</strong>
            <p>Some fundamental results about linear maps on normed spaces are presented. \(p\)-norms for \(0 \lt p \lt 1 \) are then looked at, leading to a study of so-called "quasinormed spaces" (the "norm" is allowed to satisfy a weakened triangle inequality).</p>
            <p><strong>Materials</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="Linear Maps between (Quasi)Normed Spaces.pdf" target="_blank">Slides</a> presented to professors and peers in June 2024</li>
                <li><a href="Project_Poster.pdf" target="_blank">Poster</a> exhibited in the UCL Main Campus in November 2024, now displayed inside the UCL Department of Mathematics</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Thoughts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>So far, it appears to me that the process of learning mathematics could be analogous to constructing a building: our instructors offer blueprints and scaffolding, but it is up to us, in our minds, to erect and furnish our own houses. Through sharing, we may welcome into our abodes our fellows; together, we may notice differences in our styles. I think from each person's specially styled brick, laid together, emerges our mansion of mathematics. In this section, I might record some ideas on the topic as they change with time, and in doing so, I hope I can contribute to sharing.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>I think an independence from notation and sequence of presentation can indicate when an adequate understanding of an area is attained. That is, if things were to carry different notation, or characterisations and definitions swapped, there ought not to be much effect on the scholar &mdash; after all, the underlying theory remains unaffected. But, I still think there is something to be said for how a theory may be arranged for presentation. Understanding the choices behind different arrangements may not say anything about the content of the theory, but it may offer a view on the theory itself.</p>
