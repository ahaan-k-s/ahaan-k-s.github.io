            <strong>UCL Final Year Project</strong>
            <p>I'll update this as the project comes along.</p>

            <strong>Galois' Theory and the algebraic closedness of \(\mathbf{C}\)</strong>
            <p>A proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra is presented, using ideas from Galois' Theory.</p>
            <p><strong>Materials</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="Galois.pdf" target="_blank">Slides</a> presented to professors, and classmates of the Galois' Theory class at UCL in December 2024</li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>This was part of a group project. We decided to collect only the results necessary to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. By recording a few more results, the treatment may be offered in the more general context of ordered fields inside which every positive element has a square root, and every odd-degree polynomial has a zero. This could lead to a study of the "algebraic closure" of a field.</i></p>

            <strong>UCL Year 2 Research Project</strong>
            <p>Some fundamental results about linear maps on normed spaces are presented. \(p\)-norms for \(0 \lt p \lt 1 \) are then looked at, leading to a study of so-called "quasinormed spaces" (the "norm" is allowed to satisfy a weakened triangle inequality).</p>
            <p><strong>Materials</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="Linear Maps between (Quasi)Normed Spaces.pdf" target="_blank">Slides</a> presented to professors and peers in June 2024</li>
                <li><a href="Project_Poster.pdf" target="_blank">Poster</a> exhibited in the UCL Main Campus in November 2024, now displayed inside the UCL Department of Mathematics</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>So far, it appears to me that in the process of learning mathematics, our instructors offer blueprints and scaffolding, but it is up to us to build our own houses in our minds. I think then, with each person and their special style, we get a great city.</p>
