    <h1>Ahaan Kirloskar Saini</h1>
    <p>Hi there. I intend to maintain this website to host some of my work, and share some ideas. <a href="Ahaan_Kirloskar_Saini_CV.pdf" target="_blank">View my CV here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>UCL Year 2 Research Project</strong>
            <p>Some fundamental results about linear maps on normed spaces are presented. \(p\)-norms for \(0 \lt p \lt 1 \) are then looked at, leading to a study of so-called "quasinormed spaces" (the "norm" is allowed to satisfy a weaker triangle inequality).</p>
        
            <p><strong>Materials</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="Linear Maps between (Quasi)Normed Spaces.pdf" target="_blank">Slides</a> presented to professors and peers in June 2024</li>
                <li><a href="Project_Poster.pdf" target="_blank">Poster</a> exhibited in the UCL Main Campus in November 2024, now on display on the walls inside the UCL Department of Mathematics</li>
            </ul>

        <p><i>Material concerning analgolous results in quasinormed spaces to follow.</i></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Galois' Theory and the algebraic closedness of \(\mathbf{C}\)</strong>
            <p>A proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra is presented, using ideas from Galois' Theory.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Materials</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="Galois.pdf" target="_blank">Slides</a> presented to professors, and classmates of the Galois' Theory class at UCL in December 2024.</li>
            </ul>

        <p><i>This was part of a group project. Our group decided to collect only the results necessary for proving the penulimate result for \(\mathbf{R}\). A few more results may allow the treatment in the more general context of ordered fields in which every positive element has a square root, and every odd-degree polynomial has a zero. This could lead to a study of the "algebraic closure" of a field.</i></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>UCL Year 1 Group Research Project</strong>
            <p>We expore the "tiling" of various (mutilated) chessboards by dominos, looking to employ results from Graph Theory to give conditions on when such a tiling is possible.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Materials</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Here are three very informal handwritten slides which give an introduction to the project:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="domino1.jpg" target="_blank">Slide 1</a></li>
                        <li><a href="domino2.jpg" target="_blank">Slide 2</a></li>
                        <li><a href="domino3.jpg" target="_blank">Slide 3</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <p><i>Unfortunately, we first-year students didn't take care to record our findings and store them properly, so our other materials are all but lost. However, I am currently enrolled in a Graph Theory and Combinatorics course, and it does appear that there is a fair amount to say about this topic &mdash; I may post an article in the near future.</i></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Mathematics Pedagogy</strong>
            <p>So far, it appears to me that the process of learning mathematics could be analagous to constructing a building: our instructors offer us blueprints and scaffolding, but it is up to us, in our minds, to erect and furnish our own houses of mathematics. Sharing with fellows could offer glimspes of each other's houses, and potentially some differences in appearance. In this section, I will record some ideas on the topic as they change with time, and in doing so, I hope I can promote sharing.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Materials</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="EE.pdf" target="_blank">Extended Essay</a>, submitted as part of my IB Diploma in May 2022</li>
            </ul>
            
        <p></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Problems in elementary combinatorics</strong>
            <p>I present a selection of problems in the subject, all accessible to the high-school student.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Materials</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="latex bits.tex" target="_blank">TeX File</a> yet to be cleaned up, but which contains all essential content.</li>
            </ul>

        <p><i>It seems that combinatorics was the subject of my first foray into pure mathematics. I think such puzzles have some sort of inherent quality that can make them particularly accessible &mdash; for one, they can be appreciated, at least for the most part, without being obscured by notation.</i></p>
        </li>
    </ul>
